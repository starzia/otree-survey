<p>Next we will present you questions asked in a series of national American surveys in recent years.
    Some are fact-based questions.  Some are opinion-based questions.
    For each question, you will be asked to respond to a question asking you to pick between two options, A & B.
    You will make your selection on a 7-point scale to indicate your preference for option A or B.
    The responses of previous participants in a previous survey will be visible to you next to each option,
    but you can feel free to ignore this information.  Specifically, the percentage of previous participants that
    prefer a particular option will be listed in parentheses next to each one
    (if percentages don't add up to 100 it is because there was a no-response or another option available).</p>

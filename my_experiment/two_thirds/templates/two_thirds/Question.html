<p>In this part, the money you can earn depends on your choice and the choice of all other participants.
    We will ask you to choose a number between 0 and 100.
    The computer will then calculate the average of the numbers chosen by all participants in this session.
    The participant whose chosen number is closest to 2/3 times the average of all chosen numbers will win
    {{player.max_payoff}} and the rest will receive $0.  In case of a tie, multiple players may win.

<p>Below this text you will find the eight options.  Each option offers 2 different amounts of money that you
    can win by choosing that option. Please choose one of the options. At the end of the experiment the
    computer will randomly pick one of the two payouts for the option you have chosen and you will be paid
    accordingly.
</p>

<p>To see how to read this table, consider option 5. In this
    option the possible results are {{player.payoffs.4.0}} and {{player.payoffs.4.1}}. Both are equally likely,
    which means that the computer will choose {{player.payoffs.4.0}} as the payment half the time and
    {{player.payoffs.4.1}} the other half.   Which of these two outcomes you receive depends exclusively on luck.</p>

<p>You must choose one of the 8 possible options.</p>

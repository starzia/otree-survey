<p>On the next screen you will be given 8 different options. Each option offers 2 different amounts of money that you
    can win by choosing that option. You will be asked to choose one of the options. At the end of the experiment the
    computer will randomly pick one of the outcomes for the option that you have chosen and you will be paid
    accordingly. For example, if you choose an option that offers outcomes $1.00 and $2.00, then you receive $1.00 with
    probability 50% and $2.00 with probability 50%. Hence, which of the 2 outcomes you receive depends exclusively on
    luck.

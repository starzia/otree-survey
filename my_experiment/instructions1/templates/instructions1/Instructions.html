<p>The experiment is about to begin. From now on you are not allowed to talk or to look around.
    Please switch off your cell phones. If you have any questions, please raise your hand and
    one of the experimenter will assist you.</p>

<p>This is an experiment on decision making. You will get at least $35 for participating.
    Furthermore, if you follow the instructions carefully, you can earn more money.
    The money you can earn will depend on your decisions, on the decisions of other participants
    in this session as well as on luck. The final payment will be the fixed amount of $35 plus
    the money you earn during the experiment.</p>

<p>The experiment has three parts.  At the beginning of each part we will read the detailed
    instructions on which types of decisions you can make and how your decisions will be related
    to the money you can earn.</p>

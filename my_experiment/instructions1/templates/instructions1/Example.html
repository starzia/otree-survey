<p>In this part of the experiment you will be presented with payoff matrices such as the one shown below:</p>

<div class="center">
    <p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td></td><td></td><td colspan="2">Other Participant</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td><td></td><td>{{player.shape.0|safe}}</td><td>{{player.shape.1|safe}}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">You</td><td>{{player.shape.0|safe}}</td><td class="border">1, 2</td><td class="border">3, 4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>{{player.shape.1|safe}}</td><td class="border">5, 6</td><td class="border">7, 8</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
</div>

<p>In this particular matrix, you and another participant can choose between two options, {{player.shape.0|safe}} and {{player.shape.1|safe}}, such that your money
will depend on your choice as well as on the choice of the other participant. If you both choose {{player.shape.0|safe}} then you will
earn $1 and the other participant will earn $2. If you choose {{player.shape.0|safe}} and the other participant chooses {{player.shape.1|safe}}, then you will
earn $3 and the other participant will earn $4. If you choose {{player.shape.1|safe}} and the other participant chooses {{player.shape.0|safe}}, then you will
earn $5 and the other participant will earn $6. Finally, if you both choose {{player.shape.1|safe}} then you will earn $7 and the other
    participant will get $8.</p>

<p>This is just an example for you to learn how to read a matrix. Raise your hand if you have a question.</p>

<p>You will be presented with 5 different matrices and in each of them you will have to choose between two options.
    The numbers and therefore the money you can earn will change from matrix to matrix, and the matrices will be
    different from the example above. All of you will be making decisions for the same 5 matrices. For each matrix,
    you will be matched with another participant. You will not know the identity of this person and the other person
    will not know your identity either. The matching between participants is done at random. You will not know the
    other participants' choices until the end of the experiment.</p>

{% if player.social_cues %}
<p>Right on top of each of the matrices you will find a question such as:</p>
<div class="center">
    <p>
        <img style="vertical-align:bottom; height:40px" src="/static/payoff_matrix/shape2.png">
    </p>
    <div class="form-group">
        <label class="control-label">Is this a circle or a square?</label>
        <div class="controls  field-social_cues_answer">
            <label class="radio-inline" for="id_social_cues_answer_1"><input type="radio" id="id_social_cues_answer_1"
                                                                             name="social_cues_answer"> {{player.shape.1|safe}}</label>
            <label class="radio-inline" for="id_social_cues_answer_2"><input type="radio" id="id_social_cues_answer_2"
                                                                             name="social_cues_answer"> {{player.shape.0|safe}}</label>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>You will not be able to submit your choice ({{player.shape.1|safe}} or {{player.shape.0|safe}}) for the matrix unless you click on the right answer.
    All of you will see exactly the same question and matrix.</p>
{% endif %}

<p>We will not pay you for all the 5 matrices but for one unique matrix. At the end of the experiment, one matrix will
    be randomly chosen, and the money you earn will be determined by your choice and your matched participant's choice
    in the randomly chosen matrix. At the end of the experiment, we will show you which matrix has been chosen, we will
    remind you about your choice in that particular matrix, and we will also show you your matched participant's choice
    in that particular matrix, so that you know how much you have earned in this part of the experiment.</p>

<p>If everything is clear then we will start with the first part of the experiment.</p>

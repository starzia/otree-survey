        in which you will have to choose one of 9 options. Each option represents the amount of money that you can earn
        from this task and the amount that the participant with whom you are matched can earn.</p>

    as <em>Receiver</em>. The computer will randomly select one of the 6 situations and the payment that you will
    receive is the following:</p>

        the computer</li>
